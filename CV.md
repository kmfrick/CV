# Work experience

## Research Assistant |  Paris School of Economics, France | 10/2021 - Present
-  Project work financed by the French Ministry of Labour, with the goal of designing **machine learning** models to construct reliable measures of occupation-to-occupation skill distances.
-  Data from this research project is to be used by the Ministry to guide the **design of public policies** aimed at re-training workers from distressed occupations, in order to **maximise their re-employment** chances.

## Research Intern |  Robotics and Mechatronics, University of Twente, Netherlands | 03/2020 - 06/2020
-  Erasmus+ traineeship under the supervision of prof. Stefano Stramigioli (University of Twente). Worked on the **localisation and mapping** (SLAM) capabilities of an unmanned aerial vehicle through **research and deployment** of deep **neural networks** for semantic segmentation of 3D scenes.
-  Developed a module for the ROS framework making use of the **C++ and Python** APIs of TensorFlow Lite and ONNX.
-  The project's end goal was the development of an **autonomous vehicle** able to efficiently **interact** with the environment, for example to aid or replace humans in high-risk situations such as dangerous maintenance work.

# Projects, honours and awards
-  Selected to attend the **Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-Doctoral Research School 2021**, a summer school aimed at **top students in computer science** interested in pursuing a PhD track.
-  As a student in Collegio Superiore, every year I write 5 papers based on **individual research** on topics addressed during the courses.
Selected titles include "What can economists learn from machine learning?" (published 2020), "Computer science and engineering tools for resource economics", "The evolution of the Internet between platform and infrastructure".
-  Led a team of 4 people to develop an **artificial intelligence** able to play the Nordic board game Tablut using informed tree search techniques, training metaparameters with a genetic algorithm.
Project completed in spring 2021.
-  Developed a parallelised implementation of the **Q-learning** algorithm leveraging **Xilinx FPGA** hardware using high-level synthesis tools.
Project completed in spring 2021.
-  Game engine pathfinder: developed a **pathfinding solution** in fall 2019 that is able to efficiently find optimal and collision-free paths for an arbitrary number of actors in an **open source game engine** developed in C++ and Python
-  Italian national selection for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI): **bronze medal** won in the 2016 final round of individual competitions, **third place** in the 2016 final round of team competitions.
