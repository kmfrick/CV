# Work experience

## Research Assistant \hfill  Paris School of Economics, France | 10/2021 - Present

-  Working on the design of **machine learning** models able to learn a measure of occupation-to-occupation **skill distances** of job occupational positions from textual and structured data.
-  In charge of designing an end-to-end architecture comprising a **language model** and a neural network for task-driven **representation learning** for a **skill matching** task.
-  Project work  financed by the French Ministry of Labour. Data from this research project is to be used  to **design public policies** aimed at re-training workers from distressed occupations to **maximise their re-employment** chances.

## Research Intern \hfill  University of Twente, Netherlands | 03/2020 - 06/2020
-  Researched and deployed deep **neural networks** for semantic segmentation of 3D scenes to improve the localization and mapping (SLAM) capabilities of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
-  Developed a module for the ROS framework in **C++ and Python** using TensorFlow Lite and ONNX.
-  Acquired proficiency in the process of conducting **independent research**, from state-of-the-art studies to the formulation and answering of meaningful research questions.


# Projects, honours and awards

-  Selected to attend the **Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-Doctoral Research School 2021**, a summer school aimed at **top students in computer science** interested in pursuing a PhD track.
-  As a student in Collegio Superiore, every year I write 5 papers based on **individual research**.
Selected titles include "What can economists learn from machine learning?" (published 2020), "Computer science and engineering tools for resource economics", "The evolution of the Internet between platform and infrastructure".
-  Developed R libraries (some published on CRAN) implementing **optimization algorithms** such as kernel SVMs and minimum spanning tree-based heuristics for k-means clustering.
-  Developed a C++ **network pathfinding** library to efficiently find optimal and collision-free paths for an arbitrary number of actors.
-  Designed an informed tree search-based **artificial intelligence** to compete in a board game tournament.
